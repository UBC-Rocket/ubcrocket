              <td>The rockets we are launching are suborbital, which means that they don’t enter orbit, and as such must come down immediately after going up. Since we spend so much time building the rocket and the payload in it, we would like to have the rocket come down in as controlled and safe a manner as possible. For this, parachutes are typically used, and this process is known as recovery. <a href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/Intro_to_Dual_Deployment_in_Rocketry">Click here to learn more.</a></td>

              <td>As with all rockets, there's no fundamental purpose to going up and down. The purpose of the rocket is to carry something up with it, so the purpose would depend on the payload. Our team like to maximize the usefulness of the rocket by considering as many payload options as possible, as well as enable multiple payloads to be attached.</td>
