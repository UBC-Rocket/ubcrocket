More generally, any rocket, orbital or suborbital, has the purpose of accelerating a payload to somewhere high and/or fast. Thus, the purpose is dependent on the payload. Our team like to maximize the usefulness of the rocket by considering as many payload options as possible, as well as enable multiple payloads to be attached.</td>

              <td class="col-md-8">Solid motors feature solid grains that have a fuel and oxidizer mixture, while liquid motors involve the controlled mixing of the liquid fuel and oxidizer. Hybrid motors feature propellants (the fuel and oxidizer) in different phases; usually one propellant is solid while the other is liquid or gaseous. Once solid motors are ignited, they will continue to burn until the grains are burned through, while liquid motors allow for control of flows and therefore, thrust and burn time.</td>

So far, we have designed, manufactured, pressure and flow tested our first rocket engine on campus, and have recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU29gj9I_TU/" target = "_blank">hot-fired</a> our heat-sink engine. To support propulsion testing, we have built our DarkStar test stand which will closely model the setup on the flight vehicle and allow testing of the engine in even the most remote locations. Simultaneously, we are developing a regeneratively cooled 3D DMLS printed engine, composite structures for the flight vehicle, communications systems for downlinking and uploading data to the rocket at a 100km apogee, electronics systems for controlling the rocket in flight and an active guidance system to keep our rocket pointed at the stars. We are looking for people who do not shy away from long term challenges, are able to commit a significant amount of time to the team and are self-motivated to complete tasks to extremely ambitious deadlines. You're applying at an exciting time for the Whistler Blackcomb team as we prepare for the first launch window in 2020, an unforgettable experience and one well worth being a part of.</td>
