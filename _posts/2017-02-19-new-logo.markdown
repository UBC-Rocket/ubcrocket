Ambition, growth, and passion from our team has inspired the creation of our new logo. 

10 months ago, UBC Rocket didnâ€™t exist, but a deep passion for rockets did. Stemming from the dreams of space travel and continuous dedication from our members, UBC Rocket now provides an engaging, hands-on learning platform for our 60 members who share the same drive and love for engineering. 

With the long term goal of launching a rocket to 300,000 feet, we wanted to express our ambition through the simplest, yet arguably most challenging design task of the team - our logo. With bold lettering, sleek lines, and a modern design, we hope to share with you our story of ambition, growth and pursuit for the stars. 

Thank you to Howard Huang for designing our new logo!
