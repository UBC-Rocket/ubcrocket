So they’ll commit an average of 10‑15 hours per week through the year, and 20‑30 in the weeks leading up to competitions. They’ll design, build, test, and rebuild. They’ll manage projects and people, promote the club, engage with sponsors, advocate to Ottawa, and fundraise. </p>

          <p class="text-muted">They’ll reach out to school kids in both BC and Alberta (primarily online), and build awareness, interest, and expertise in STEM subjects through Frequent Flyers, a new project in which participants of all ages design, build, and launch their own rockets and payloads."</p>
